## üìà Notebooks & Data

- **Jupyter Notebook (`Real estate price prediction.ipynb`):**  
  Contains the full workflow for data analysis, modeling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  Steps include:  
  - Importing and cleaning property data  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Building and evaluating predictive models  
  - Generating visualizations for EDA  
  - Exporting model coefficients and sample statistics for use in the interactive app

- **CSV Data File (`Real estate price prediction.csv`):**  
  The property dataset used for analysis and modeling.  
  Typical columns include:  
  - Property features (e.g., sqft_living, bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, condition, zipcode, waterfront, view, year built)  
  - Target variable: Price  
  - This file is loaded and processed in the notebook to build the predictive model and support EDA.
